## ✨ Features

DacDAQ is a complete toolkit for interfacing with lab hardware, built on a modern Python stack (`PyQt6`, `pyqtgraph`, and `Poetry`).

  - ⚡ **Non-Blocking, Threaded Architecture:** The core acquisition loop runs in a dedicated `QThread`, ensuring the GUI remains perfectly responsive, even with slow instruments.
  - 🧩 **Modular Instrument Plugins:** Easily add new hardware by creating a simple `BaseInstrument` plugin. Comes with a `SimulatedInstrument` for testing and a `Keithley2000` class for real-world use.
  - 💾 **Save & Load Configurations:** Don't re-enter settings. Save your entire setup (instrument choice, output file, comments) to a JSON file and load it instantly.
  - 📈 **High-Performance Real-Time Plotting:** Uses `pyqtgraph` to plot multiple data streams live.
  - 🔬 **Live Data Processing:** Apply real-time filters (like the built-in `MovingAverageFilter`) and plot both raw and processed data simultaneously.
  - ⏯️ **Full Run Control:** **Start**, **Stop**, **Pause**, and **Resume** your acquisition at any time.
  - 📝 **Live Event Logging:** Add timestamped comments (e.g., "Increased pressure to 10 GPa") during a run *without* stopping acquisition. Events are saved to a separate `.events.csv` file.
  - 📊 **Flexible Graph Controls:** Toggle Y-axis auto-ranging and manually set Y-min/max limits to focus on your data.
  - 📂 **Dual-File Data Sinks:** Automatically saves all data to two files: a `.csv` for raw and filtered data, and a `.events.csv` for your comments.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Get your local copy up and running in a few simple steps.

### Prerequisites

  - `Python 3.10+`
  - `Poetry` (for package management)
  - A backend for `pyvisa` (if using real hardware), e.g., `NI-VISA`

### Installation & Running

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/jhamlin-ufl/dacdaq.git
cd dacdaq

# 2. Install dependencies with Poetry
# This creates a virtual environment and installs all packages
poetry install

# 3. Run the application
poetry run python run_app.py
```

### How to Use

1.  The **Configure** dialog will appear.
2.  Click **"Load Config..."** to load a previous setup, or...
3.  Select your instrument (e.g., "Keithley 2000").
4.  Click **"Browse..."** to choose an output CSV file.
5.  Add pre-run comments.
6.  Click **"Save Config..."** to save this setup for next time.
7.  Click **"OK"** to start the main application.

### Branching Strategy

\<details\>
\<summary\>\<strong\>Click to expand our GitFlow Branching Strategy\</strong\>\</summary\>

This project uses a branching model based on **GitFlow**.

  * 🌲 **`main`**: This branch contains production-ready, tagged releases. All code on `main` is stable and deployable. **Do not commit directly to this branch.**
  * 🛠️ **`develop`**: This is the main development branch. It contains the latest "work-in-progress" code. All feature branches are merged into `develop`.
  * ✨ **`feature/your-feature-name`**: Create these branches from `develop` for any new feature.
      * *Example:* `feature/add-hdf5-support`
  * 🐞 **`fix/bug-description`**: Create these branches from `develop` to fix a non-urgent bug.
      * *Example:* `fix/memory-leak-in-streamer`
  * 🔥 **`hotfix/issue-name`**: Create these branches from `main` *only* to fix a critical, production-breaking bug. This branch is merged into both `main` and `develop`.
